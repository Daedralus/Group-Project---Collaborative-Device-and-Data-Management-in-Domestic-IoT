# Group Project - Collaborative Device and Data Management in Domestic IoT
This is the repository for my second year group project in university. It took place for the entire year and the title is also the name of our project. Analysing the requirements of the project, I knew that I could incorporate the solution I learned from my internship just a month before the start of this project. 

As such, I worked as the tech lead of the group, ensuring a good technical direction of the overall product and appropriate coding practices. I also mentored the group through the year as they were unfamiliar with what I had already learned and used during my internship. We had 3 major components to our project and had split into 3 groups to work on the project. 

One team would work on the physical IoT device with python. One team would work on the front-end UI of the application to control the IoT using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The final team, which I was in, worked on the backend, using C#, .NET Core, MongoDB, REST API as I had learned from my internship. I was also the one who worked on getting and hosting servers and domains in order to launch our application as a web application, and setting up automated tests to test all APIs with a single click. Towards the completion of the project, I also helped both of the other teams in their python and javascript scripts for communicating with the backend.
